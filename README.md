# 👋 Hi, I’m Gurchetan Singh – @apaleblueman

I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Chandigarh University, passionate about **Full Stack Development**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Linux ecosystems**. I love building practical tools, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open source. My international academic experience at Capilano University (Canada) has given me a well-rounded perspective on problem-solving and collaboration.
